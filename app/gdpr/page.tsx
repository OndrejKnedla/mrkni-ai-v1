          <p className="text-white/90">
            If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at privacy@mrkniai.com.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white/90 mt-4">
            We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right
            to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure
            that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white/90 mt-4">
            We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a
            month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will
            notify you and keep you updated.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">7. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
          <p className="text-white/90">
            We will only process your personal data when we have a legal basis to do so. The legal basis will depend on
            the purposes for which we have collected and use your personal data. In almost all cases, the legal basis
            will be one of the following:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-white/90 space-y-2 mt-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Consent</strong> - You have given us consent to process your personal data for a specific purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Contract</strong> - The processing is necessary for a contract we have with you, or because you
              have asked us to take specific steps before entering into a contract.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Legal obligation</strong> - The processing is necessary for us to comply with the law.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Legitimate interests</strong> - The processing is necessary for our legitimate interests or the
              legitimate interests of a third party, unless there is a good reason to protect your personal data which
              overrides those legitimate interests.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">8. Data Retention</h2>
          <p className="text-white/90">
            We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for,
            including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white/90 mt-4">
            To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and
            sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your
            personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those
            purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">9. Data Security</h2>
          <p className="text-white/90">
            We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally
            lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your
            personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to
            know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of
            confidentiality.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white/90 mt-4">
            We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any
            applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">10. International Transfers</h2>
          <p className="text-white/90">
            We may transfer your personal data to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Whenever we
            transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by
            ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-white/90 space-y-2 mt-2">
            <li>
              We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level
              of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission
              which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
            </li>
          </ul>
